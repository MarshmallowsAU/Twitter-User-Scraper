# Web-Scraper

Hi there!

This repo contains a JavaScript Twitter User Scraper built with Node.js.

Credit to _George Gkasdrogkas_ for his article _How to build your own Twitter scraper tool using Browserless and Node.js_ for giving me the framework to use. 

Note: In the file _twitterUserScraper.js_ you will see ${BROWSERLESS-API-KEY}. In order to use this scraper you must register with https://www.browserless.io/ and replace the prior mentioned slot with the API key given to you after creating your profile.

Thanks for checking out my repo! I hope you enjoy!
